OO File System

The assignment is to design and implement an in-memory file system. This file-system consists of 4 types of entities: Drives, Folders, Text files, Zip files.

These entities, very much like their “real” file-system counterparts, obey the following relations.
a.	A folder, a drive or a zip file, may contain zero to many other folders, or files (text or zip).
b.	A text file does not contain any other entity.
c.	A drive is not contained in any entity.
d.	Any non-drive entity must be contained in another entity.
If entity A contains entity B then we say that A is the parent of B.

Every entity has the following properties:
⦁	Type – The type of the entity (one of the 4 type above).
⦁	Name - An alphanumeric string. Two entities with the same parent cannot have the same name. Similarly, two drives cannot have the same name.
⦁	Path – The concatenation of the names of the containing entities, from the drive down to and including the entity. The names are separated by ‘\’.
⦁	A text file has a property called Content which is a string. 
⦁	Size – an integer defined as follows:
⦁	For a text file – it is the length of its content.
⦁	For a drive or a folder, it is the sum of all sizes of the entities it contains.
⦁	For a zip file, it is one half of the sum of all sizes of the entities it contains.

The system should be capable of supporting file-system like operations

1)	Create – Creates a new entity.
Arguments: Type, Name, Path of parent.
Exceptions: Path not found; Path already exists; Illegal File System Operation (if any of the rules a-d above is violated).
2)	Delete – Deletes an existing entity (and all the entities it contains).
Arguments: Path
Exceptions: Path not found.
3)	Move – Changing the parent of an entity.
Arguments: Source Path, Destination Path. 
Exceptions: Path not found; Path already exists, Illegal File System Operation.
4)	WriteToFile – Changes the content of a text file.
Arguments: Path, Content
Exceptions: Path not found; Not a text file.

Tasks:
a.	Come up with the design for this system. Full implementation is not required, but only to the level which you feel is a “proof of concept”. 
b.	Show a sketch of implementation of the Move operation.
c.	Explicitly implement the property Size. 

Choose whatever OO language you are comfortable with – preferably Java or C#.
